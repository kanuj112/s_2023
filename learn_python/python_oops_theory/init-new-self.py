========__init__================
================================
1. The __init__ function is called a constructor, or initializer, and is 
automatically called when you create a new instance of a class.
Within that function, the newly created object is assigned to the parameter self .
The notation self.legs is an attribute called legs of the object in the variable self
2. __init__ is called when ever an object of the class is constructed.
That means when ever we will create a student object we will see the message 
“A student object is created” in the prompt
3. All classes have a function called __init__(), which is always executed when the class is being initiated.
4. Use the __init__() function to assign values to object properties, or other operations that are necessary 
to do when the object is being created
5. def __new__(self,p1,p2) or def __new__(cls,p1,p2)

====================================
1. self represents the instance of the class. By using the "self" keyword we can access 
the attributes and methods of the class in python.


==>Use __new__ when you need to control the creation of a new instance. 
==>Use __init__ when you need to control initialization of a new instance.

==>__new__ is the first step of instance creation. 
It's called first, and is responsible for returning a new instance of your class. 
In contrast, __init__ doesn't return anything; it's only responsible for initializing the instance 
after it's been created.

or
