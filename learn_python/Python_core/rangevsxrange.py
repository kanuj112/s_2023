#Range vs xrange 
=================================
range() vs xrange() in Python
=================================
1. range() and xrange() are two functions that could be used to 
iterate a certain number of times in for loops in Python. 
2. In Python 3, there is no xrange , but the range function behaves 
3. like xrange in Python 2.
4. If you want to write code that will run on both Python 2 and Python 3, you should use range().
===============================
1. range() – This returns a list of numbers created using range() function.
2. xrange() – This function returns the generator object that can be used to 
display numbers only by looping. Only particular range is displayed on demand 
and hence called “lazy evaluation“.
===============================
1. Both are implemented in different ways and have different characteristics associated with them.
The points of comparisons are:
1. Return Type
2. Memory
3. Operation Usage
4. Speed
==========================================
1. Return Type :
range() returns – the list as return type.
xrange() returns – xrange() object.
Python code to demonstrate range() vs xrange() on  basis of return type 
initializing a with range() 
a = range(1,10000) 
initializing a with xrange() 
x = xrange(1,10000) 
testing the type of a 
print ("The return type of range() is : ") 
print (type(a)) 
testing the type of x 
print ("The return type of xrange() is : ") 
print (type(x)) 
============================================
2. Memory:
The variable storing the range created by range() takes more memory as 
compared to variable storing the range using xrange().
The basic reason for this is the return type of range() is
list and xrange() is xrange() object.
==============================================
3. Operations usage
As range() returns the list, all the operations that can be 
applied on the list can be used on it. On the other hand, as 
xrange() returns the xrange object, operations associated to list
cannot be applied on them, hence a disadvantage.
==============================================
4. Speed :
Because of the fact that xrange() evaluates only 
the generator object containing only the values that are 
required by lazy evaluation, therefore is faster in 
implementation than range().
================================================
For the most part, xrange and range are the exact same in terms 
of functionality. They both provide a way to generate a list of 
integers for you to use, however you please. The only difference 
is that range returns a Python list object and xrange returns an xrange object
================================================
5. range() and xrange() Functionality
In terms of functionality both range() and xrange() functions generates integer numbers within given range.
i.e range (1,5,1) will produce [1,2,3,4] and xrange(1,5,1)  will produce [1,2,3,4]
so no difference in terms of functionality between range() and xrange().
================================================
6. range() and xrange() return value
6.1. range() creates a list i.e. range returns a Python list object, for example, 
range (1,500,1) will create a python list of 499 integers in memory. remember, 
range() generates all numbers at once.
6.2. xrange() functions returns an xrange object that evaluates lazily. 
that means xrange only stores the range arguments and generates the 
numbers on demand. it doesn’t generate all numbers at once like range(). and 
this object only supports indexing, iteration, and the len() function.
on the other hand xrange() generates the numbers on demand. that means it produces number 
one by one as for Loop moves to the next number. In every iteration of for loop, 
it generates the next number and assigns it to the iterator variable of for loop.
===============================================
7. range() and xrange() return type
-->range() return type is Python list.
-->xrange()  function returns xrange object.
As you know xrange doesn’t actually generate a static list at run-time like range does. 
xrange() creates the values on demand as you need them using a technique called yielding.
range() function produced all numbers instantaneously before the for loop started executing.
The main problem with the original range() function is it uses a very large amount of memory 
if you are producing a huge range of numbers
================================================
xrange() function always produces the next number on the fly i.e. 
only keeps one number in memory at a time to consume less memory.
================================================
If you are dealing with a large range of numbers then I recommend you to use xrange()
i.e. you should always favor xrange() over a range() if we want to generate the huge range of numbers.
This is very helpful if your system has less memory like cell phones. 
using xrange() you can prevent memory overflow errors.
As xrange() resolves each number lazily, if you stop iteration early,
you won’t waste time creating the whole list.
===========================================
Scenarios where we can use range() function in python :
If you want to iterate over the list multiple times then I recommend you to use range().
because xrange has to generate an integer object every time you access an index, this will be overhead.
If you need to generate fewer numbers then go for range() function.
range() returns the list, so you can use all list operations on it.
On the other hand, you know xrange() returns the xrange object, so you can’t use all list operations on it.
Compatibility of code – If you want to write code that will run on both Python 2 and Python 3,
use range() as the xrange function is deprecated in Python 3.
================================================
