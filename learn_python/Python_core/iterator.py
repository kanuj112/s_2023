=======================
1. Iterators are objects that can be iterated upon.
2. Technically speaking, Python iterator object must implement two special methods,
3.  __iter__() and __next__(), collectively called the iterator protocol.
4. An iterator is an object that contains a countable number of values.
5. Lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets are all iterable objects. They are iterable containers which you can get an iterator from.
6. All these objects have a iter() method which is used to get an iterator:
=====================
my_list = [4, 7, 0, 3]
my_iter = iter(my_list)
print(next(my_iter))
print(next(my_iter))
print(my_iter.__next__())
print(my_iter.__next__())
next(my_iter)
