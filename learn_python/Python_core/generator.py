#generator :
==============================
#Generator 
#a generator is a function that returns an object (iterator) which we can iterate over (one value at a time).
#If a function contains at least one yield statement (it may contain other yield or return statements), 
#it becomes a generator function. Both yield and return will return some value from a function.
#The difference is that, while a return statement terminates a function entirely, yield 
#statement pauses the function saving all its states and later continues from there on successive calls.
#every generator is an iterator, but not every iterator is a generator
#Generator function contains one or more yield statement.
#When called, it returns an object (iterator) but does not start execution immediately.
#Methods like __iter__() and __next__() are implemented automatically. So we can iterate through the items using next().
#Once the function yields, the function is paused and the control is transferred to the caller.
#Local variables and their states are remembered between successive calls.
#Finally, when the function terminates, StopIteration is raised automatically on further calls.
#It is also called lazy evaluation

whenever we are using object, we need to  apply "next" keyword.
print(next(x));  # In Python 3, __next__()
print(x.__next__());  # In Python 3, __next__()
#x is object
